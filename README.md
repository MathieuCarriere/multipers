# multipers
Package for computing multiparameter persistence summaries. This is the code accompanying the article "Multiparameter persistence image for topological machine learning" (NeurIPS 2020). The notebooks contain code for reproducing experiments (`experiments.ipynb`) and testing simple cases (`visualization.ipynb`). We also provide an executable vineyards algorithm (compiled in Ubuntu 18.04) in `bin/vine`. Such a compiled executable file is required to run the code, so if you are not under Ubuntu 18.04, you can manually compile the following C++ file from the Dionysus library: https://hg.mrzv.org/Dionysus/file/tip/examples/pl-functions/pl-vineyard.cpp. A custom implementation of the vineyards algorithm from the authors (which is also in C++) is also available upon request (by sending an email to mathieu.carriere3@gmail.com).
